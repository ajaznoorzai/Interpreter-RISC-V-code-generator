# Interpreter-RISC-V-code-generator



The coursework is worth 50% of your grade for this module. It consists of two tasks — each of which will be graded separately, out of 100 marks. These tasks are worth the following amounts of your coursework grade:

Task 1: Interpreter
— worth 70% of your coursework grade;

Task 2: RISC-V code generator
— worth 30% of your coursework grade;
Your solutions to these are all to be submitted together as a single file, according to a specific format.
Please see the submission guidelines for details.

 

For each task, we will award marks as follows:

Task 1: You willl get partial marks if it seems as though it is actually trying to solve the problem, or could parse the inputs with a bit of debugging.

Awarded according to how many of the test inputs can be parsed correctly by your grammar.
Execution: 10 %
Awarded according to how many of the test inputs successfuly run on your code.
Correctness: 10%
Awarded according to how many of the test inputs produce the correct outcome on your code.
Task 2: You willl get partial marks if it seems as though it is actually trying to solve the problem, or could parse the inputs with a bit of debugging.
